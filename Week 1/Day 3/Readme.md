# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

* Explain what data types are and why they are important in Python programming
* Identify and define the integer, float, boolean, and string data types in Python
* Use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable in Python
* Use basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers and floats
* Use the `round()` function to round floats to a specified number of decimal places
* Use boolean values and expressions to represent true/false statements
* Use the `not` keyword to switch the value of a boolean variable
* Define and manipulate string variables in Python, including calculating their length, converting them to other data types (e.g. float), and concatenating them with other strings or integers.
