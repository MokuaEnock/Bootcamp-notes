## Introduction

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns from labeled data to predict an output for new, unseen inputs. The goal of supervised learning is to build a model that can accurately predict the output for new examples based on what it has learned from the labeled data. The labeled data consists of inputs and corresponding outputs or labels. The algorithm learns to generalize from this data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen examples.

Where Y is the predicted output that is determined by a mapping function that assigns a class to an input value x. The function used to connect input features to a predicted output is created by the machine learning model during training.

#### 1. Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts a categorical label for an input. In other words, it is used to classify inputs into a set of predefined categories or classes. For example, a classification algorithm can be used to predict whether an email is spam or not based on the email's content and metadata.

There are two main types of classification algorithms: binary classification and multi-class classification. Binary classification involves predicting one of two possible outcomes, such as yes or no, spam or not spam, or true or false. Multi-class classification involves predicting one of several possible outcomes, such as identifying the type of flower based on its characteristics (e.g., iris setosa, iris virginica, or iris versicolor).

Some popular classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs).

#### 2. Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous numerical output for an input. In other words, it is used to predict a value on a continuous scale, such as predicting a house price based on its size and location.

There are different types of regression algorithms, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. Linear regression is a simple algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to the data. Polynomial regression is a more complex algorithm that models nonlinear relationships by fitting a polynomial curve to the data.

In summary, supervised learning algorithms learn by example and are trained using labeled data. Classification algorithms are used to predict categorical labels, while regression algorithms are used to predict continuous numerical outputs.
